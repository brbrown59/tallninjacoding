		<p>Color Scheme: charcoal grey/black with white text, possible hints of red used for borders</p>
		<p>The portfolio layout was not included here (for MVP), and also for the current lack of content.  The buttons to link to them were included in the home page layouts, but can be removed.</p>
		<p>The contact link in the header menu links to the contact form section of the about me page.</p>
